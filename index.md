# School

## Student Run Computing and Technology (SRCT)

- Contributor to the [What's Open's API](https://git.gmu.edu/srct/whats-open).
- Project Manager of the [What's Open Android app](https://git.gmu.edu/srct/whats-open-android).

## Course Work

- BS in Information Technology from George Mason University with a concentration in database technology and programming.
- Intended graduation: June 2020.
- GPA: 3.52.

# Leidos Experience

- Summer intern in 2017, returned for a co-op in the Spring and Summer of 2018 and returned again for the summer of 2019.
- As an intern at Leidos, I've collaborated with other developers using GitLab to perform the following functions in small teams and often independently.

## DevOps

- Writing a docker-compose.yml script for quick setup and development of our trilateration system.
- Registering a runner and writing a gitlab-ci.yml script for automated testing of the trilateration system that is fully integrated into our GitLab instance.

## Android Development (Java)

- Integrating multiple open-source applications using intents to perform a task to reduce application development time, increase code quality, improve security, and improve re-usability.
- Integrating an Android phone with a reverse-engineered Software Defined Radio using custom Android services with the AIDL interface
- Interfacing a cross-platform open-source application's JavaScript with native Android hardware capabilities.
- Wrote an application to beacon Bluetooth Low-Energy packets with fine-grained controls over speed of beacon frequency and power level.
- Later helped improve this beaconing application for demonstration to a customer of our trilateration system's ability to determine the phone's location.

## C/C++ development experience

- Reverse-engineering a Software Defined Radio's DLL files to understand how it interfaces over USB.
- Wrote a buffering system using a Linked List for communication between a Raspberry Pi 0 and a server.

## Python Experience

- Writing C extensions to assist in reverse-engineering a Software Defined Radio.
- Developing and debugging a back-end for determining phone's position, then associating that position with different attributes. Challenges in this system included identifying memory leaks due to low-level endian differences between Python and C code. The system was heavily mult-threaded and highly performant.
- Writing an xml standard (schema) and a parser for it in python that converts XML elements and attributes into network rules using the Linux tool tc.
- Writing an API using the Django-rest-framework for the trilateration system.

## SQL Experience

- Managing the database used to develop the trilateration applications.
- Removed a single-point-of-failure in our trilateration system using greatest n per group analysis. This simultaneously improved accuracy, reliability, and performance in our system.

## Research

- Researching, then modifying open source android apps to meet customer needs.
- Performing a formal trade study on Managed File Transfer products.
